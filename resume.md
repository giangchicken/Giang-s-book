## **Objective**  
I am passionate about leveraging **Data Science & AI** to solve complex business challenges and optimize decision-making. With a strong technical background and a deep understanding of data-driven strategies, I seek opportunities to work in **collaborative, innovative** environments that foster continuous learning and impact-driven problem-solving.

## **Experiments & Projects**  

## **Location Tracking**
- **Description:** At the request of the HCVN Purchasing Department, we developed a **location tracking system** to update outdated addresses to their most recent versions. By extracting changes from public administrative units and legal decrees using GPT, we structured these changes in a **graph database**. After carefully cleaning the input data and handling outliers, we released an **API** for them to integrate.
- **Tasks:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), fuzzy matching for location names, building a demo graph database.
- **Technologies:** Neo4j, GPT API.

### **M&A News Detection Model**  
- **Description:** I have developed a **Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) detection model** to classify M&A-related news articles,  with automated training and data processing in a containerized environment.
- **Tasks:** Doc Embedding, Hybrid search optimization, containerization.  
- **Technologies:** Auto-ML, Hybrid Search (Keywords Search + Semantic Search), Qdrant.

### **Credit Scoring Model Using Telco Data (MBF & VNPT)**  
- **Description:** Using Telco data and Sales Funnel log results, I built a credit scoring model for **customer creditworthiness assessment**.  I focused on selecting features to mitigate data shift issues and applied evolutional algorithm to feature selection and hyper parameter tuning.
- **Tasks:** Feature engineering, model training, and performance monitoring.  
- **Technologies:** Machine Learning Algorithms, PySpark.

### **Word correction Model**  
- **Description:** Developed a word correction model leveraging **Transformer-based architectures** to improve text accuracy and readability. The model was fine-tuned for error correction and deployed for real-world applications.  
- **Tasks:** Model training, fine-tuning Transformer-based architectures, deployment.  
- **Technologies:** Transformer, Pytorch, NLP.

### **Customer Identification Using Face Tracking**  
- **Description:** This was my graduation project at university, where I built a **face-embedding model** and **search system** for identifying **existing & new customers** in stores to enable personalized marketing.  
- **Tasks:** Face embedding, feature extraction, vector database storage.  
- **Technologies:** YOLOv7, ResNet50, Qdrant, PyTorch.

### **Nearest Neighbor Search for Lead Grouping in Marketing**  
- **Description:** This was a research project I conducted at 3TIT after my leads incidentally shared the **FAISS** paper with me. Inspired by its potential, I applied it to big data and implemented a KNN-based lead grouping system to enhance targeted marketing.  
- **Tasks:** Data preprocessing, KNN-based clustering, search optimization.  
- **Technologies:** KMeans, Faiss, Pyspark.

### **Domain Segmentation Model Using Web Text**  
- **Description:** This idea was inspired by the paper **"Text-Based Network Industries and Endogenous Product Differentiation"**. I scraped web text from various domains, leveraging content extraction libraries and **SBERT** to generate vector representations for each domain. This was followed by a **distributed computation process** to calculate the similarity matrix under **RAM limitations** and select an appropriate **clustering algorithm**.
- **Tasks:** Web scraping, text vectorization, clustering.  
- **Technologies:** Playwright, Clustering Algorithms (KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, HDBSCAN,..), Dask, Polars, Text embedding Model.

### **Income Prediction from Satellite Imagery**  
- **Description:** I implemented a model to predict **income levels** based on **satellite imagery** from **Google Earth Engine**.  
- **Tasks:** Data collection, preprocessing, CNN-based model application.  
- **Technologies:** CNN, Google Earth Engine, Docker.
