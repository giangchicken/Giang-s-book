# **Summary of the Paper: "Using Publicly Available Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning to Understand Economic Well-Being in Africa"**

---


## **Introduction**

The paper addresses the **need for accurate local-level measurements of economic well-being** to support effective policy-making and targeted programs in developing regions, particularly **in Africa**. Traditional survey methods for measuring asset wealth are often **infrequent and costly**, leading to **gaps in data availability**. The authors propose an approach using **publicly available multispectral satellite imagery** combined with **deep learning** to predict **asset wealth** across approximately **20,000 African villages**, offering a **timely and scalable method** for economic estimation. 

> Output of model is **wealth index**.

## **Results**

The study demonstrates that **deep learning models trained on satellite imagery** can **explain about 70% of the variation** in ground-measured village wealth, **outperforming previous benchmarks** that used high-resolution imagery. Furthermore, these models can explain **up to 50% of the variation in district-aggregated wealth changes** over time. The **errors in satellite-based estimates** are also **comparable to those in existing ground data**, indicating the **reliability** of satellite imagery as an economic measurement tool.

### **Key Findings to Note**

*Figure Description:*  
**Figure 1** illustrates the efficacy of satellite-based predictions in explaining **variations in survey-measured wealth estimates** across multiple African countries. The CNN model (MS+NL) predictions are validated against **ground-truth survey measures** (DHS and census data) using a 5-fold cross-validation approach. Key panels include:

- **(a)**:   Frequency of nationally representative household consumption expenditure or asset  wealth surveys across Africa, 2000–2016
- **(b)**:  Average household revisit rate for surveys and average location revisit rate for various resolutions of satellite imagery over time. Survey revisit rate, the average time elapsed between observations of a given household in nationally representative expenditure or wealth surveys, is calculated as number of total person-days (population×365) divided by the number of person-days observed in a given year. Satellite revisit rate estimates are calculated as the number of days in a year divided by the average number of images taken in a year across 500 randomly sampled DHS clusters in African countries, only counting images with <30% cloud cover.

*Figure Description:*  
**Figure 2** Satellite-based predictions explain **the majority of variation in survey-based wealth estimates** in all countries, and validate well against independent ground measures. Key panels include:

- **(a)**: Shows predicted wealth index vs. survey-measured wealth index across all locations and survey years. Each point represents a survey enumeration area (roughly a village), and satellite predictions are generated by the CNN MS+NL model for each country using a model trained outside that country. The red *R²* values report pooled observation fit, while black *R²* values are averaged within country-years.
- **(b)**: Similar to (a) but aggregated to the **district level**.
- **(c)**: Displays average *R²* over survey years at the **village level**, by country.
- **(d)**: Displays average *R²* over survey years at the **district level**, by country.
- **(e)**: Compares DHS-based asset wealth to independent census-based measures at the **district level**, for available census measures taken within four years of the DHS survey.
- **(f)**: Compares CNN-predicted wealth indices (trained on held-out countries) with independent **census-based asset wealth** measures at the district level.

*Note:* In panels (b), (e), and (f), the reported *R²* values are weighted and unweighted by the **number of villages** contributing to each district-level average, with dot size representing the number of villages.

## **Modeling Approach**

The authors utilize a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** architecture to predict **village-specific wealth measures** from satellite imagery. Key aspects of the model include:

- **Input Data**: The model uses **multispectral daytime imagery** from **Landsat (30m/pixel)** and **nighttime lights imagery** as inputs, both **temporally and spatially matched**.
- **Architecture**: The CNN is designed to **learn features from both daytime and nighttime imagery** in an **end-to-end training process**. Separate models are trained for each imagery type and are **combined in a final fully connected layer**.
- **Training Process**: Models are trained using a **mean squared error loss function**, optimized with the **Adam optimizer**, and incorporate **data augmentation** to prevent overfitting.

## **Data and Quality**

The study leverages both **satellite imagery** and **ground truth data**:

- **Satellite Imagery**: Publicly available **multispectral images** from **Landsat** and **nighttime lights data**. These are processed into **3-year median composites** to reduce cloud cover effects.
- **Ground Truth Data**: Asset wealth data sourced from **Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)** (2009-2016) covering **500,000+ households** across **19,669 villages** in **23 African countries**. An **asset wealth index** is created using **principal component analysis (PCA)** based on household asset data.
- **Data Collection Challenges**: The study notes challenges from **random GPS displacement in survey data**, which introduces **noise** and affects **spatial accuracy** when matching with satellite imagery.

This comprehensive approach illustrates the **feasibility of using satellite imagery and deep learning** to generate **reliable economic estimates**, providing a valuable resource for **researchers and policymakers** in regions where data is scarce.
